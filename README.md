# Streamlit_Vizualization_ML_1. EDA & Vizualization is key step in ML. In this project I will develope & discuss lot of web projects developed in Streamlite.
Speed is the essence in today's fast paced world. One of fastest way to build/deploy ML/AI models & projects in through web app. One option is to host through hiroku 
OR use STREAMLIT application from python.
The fastest way to build and share data apps. Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. 
if you haven't already check @streamlit it completely changed the way I think about prototypes and data apps. Removes a lot of frontend and design barriers for us data nerds.
if you do ML and work with Data@streamlit will breathe life into your work. It is when you can write it in Python itself. Make your machine learning app pretty and shareable with @streamlit.

## ml_random_forrest_algo.py ==> This web based project to access power of RANDOM FORREST ML algo. This app builds a regression model using the **Random Forest** algorithm.
This WEB app allows u to upload any raw data file to provide you the model using RM.
One can play with key params of Random Forrest that is ==> Number of estimators & Seed number (random_state)

## ml_hyperparam_optimizer.py ==> The Machine Learning Hyperparameter Optimization Web App. This app allows any user to use this web to play with all possible combination
of hyper params to arrive at best possible output/score in ML. Here also user can upload any raw data file in this web page & start playing with params to find the 
optium combination.

## To execute these programs use :
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run ml_hyperparam_optimizer.py
